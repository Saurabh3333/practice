The following problems come from a blog post on 20 August, 2013, by
Robert Smith, entitled
[The Wretched Google Interview Experience](http://symbo1ics.com/blog/?p=2055).
In it, he describes some of the technical problems he was asked to
solve while being interviewed by Google employees.

Since the questions are now public, I'm going to consider them
"burned" for further use in interviews and thus fair game for
discussion.

In this directory, I will offer some sample solutions that I have
written for these problems.  I'm using Python, mainly because it's
succinct and easy to read, but the ideas behind the solutions should
be transportable to most commonly used programming languages.  Before
each solution, I have offered a discussion of the problem and the
ideas behind my solutions.

**I strongly encourage you to solve the problems yourself before
examining my solutions.** You learn by doing.  If you want to get
better at solving problems like these, you must solve problems like
these: There is no short cut.

After solving a problem, compare your solution to mine to see if
either of us missed an opportunity.  (And if you think I missed one,
please
[open an issue](https://github.com/tmoertel/practice/issues/new) to
let me know.  You have my thanks.)

Happy Hacking!
