# Tom's Practice Repo README

This repository hosts some of the programming problems I've solved for
fun and practice.  For the most part, I used Python, mainly because
it's succinct and easy to read, but the ideas behind the solutions
should be transportable to most commonly used programming languages.
Before most solutions, I have offered a discussion of the problem and
the ideas behind my solutions.

**I strongly encourage you to solve the problems yourself before
examining my solutions.** You learn by doing.  If you want to get
better at solving problems like these, you must solve problems like
these. There is no short cut.

After solving a problem, compare your solution to mine to see if
either of us missed an opportunity.  (And if you think I missed one,
please
[open an issue](https://github.com/tmoertel/practice/issues/new) to
let me know.  You have my thanks.)

Happy Hacking!
